# A Star Wars RPG

This is a Star wars Javascript game that I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I utilized game logic and sprites to create an interactive and fun experience. 

The is music, sound effects and animation that are triggered by events in the game. 

I made sure that the attacks for each character are different each time to create a unique gameplay experience each time.

You can play the game [here](https://johnbendfeldt.github.io/starwarsrpg/).

May the Force be with you.
